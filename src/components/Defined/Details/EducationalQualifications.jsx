      <p>Well, I'm a class 12 pass in the CBSE board of India. 'Science group with Computer Science'. Or, 'PCMC' (standing for Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, and Computer Science)</p>
      <p>Obviously English is included since it's the CBSE board, but these four are the main subjects that identify the students course of studies in the last two years of schooling</p>
      <p>I didn't get a college degree - I did join a government polytechnic but dropped out. I wished to not go the same route I did my whole life but that didn't stop me from making more mistakes</p>
      <p>I did succeed to become a self taught developer - but now I am working on my qualifications. Although at the moment I'm not engaged in formal studies, I intend to get a Bachelor's degree in Science, along with Accounting Qualifications</p>
      <p>I will remain a programmer nonetheless. But I wish to be able to use Science and apply them practically with economics in mind - and use technology as a means to make applications more practical, more feasible, and more likely, accessible.</p>
      <p>These are lofty goals. But we start one step at a time. And we can always begin to learn from our mistakes and move ahead.</p>
