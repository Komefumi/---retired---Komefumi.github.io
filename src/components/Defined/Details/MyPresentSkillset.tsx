      <p>My present skillset... To be honest I did stagnate. Far too much.</p>
      <p>
        But I will mention the relevent: Modern web development with JavaScript
        and TypeScript - I can comfortably handle both React and Angular
        workflows. I am comfortable with Vue.js, but I&apos;ve used the two
        other frameworks much more.
      </p>
      <p>
        It&apos;s not hard to pick up any web framework once there&apos;s a good
        degree of comfort with JavaScript; and also, I feel working with React
        and Angular lend to making one flexible and also comfortable with any
        kind of paradigm needed - be it ones that come from there being build
        tools as there are in this ecosystem, or the kind of strategies that
        modern web development employs to build it&apos;s applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        I&apos;m not terrible with dealing with vector and raster graphics.
        I&apos;ve some experience with Inkscape, less with Gimp. In the section
        of what I&apos;m working towards, I mention that I&apos;m working
        towards becoming a &apos;product builder&apos; and it&apos;s only
        logical that I use and learn to use graphics tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I use Linux as my primary operating system and have been doing so for
        the past few years, my choice of software are by and large open source,
        and out of necessity as well, not premium software that runs only on
        Windows and OS X
      </p>
      <p>
        I&apos;m comfortable with other programming languages. Groovy, Clojure,
        and Java - I am putting some focus on becoming better with the JVM
        ecosystem. It is mature, and much enterprise work happens with Java and
        JVM technologies being central to them.
      </p>
      <p>
        But just in case, you&apos;re wondering if I would be well suited to
        handle anything (project or whatnot) that might require a specific
        skillset you are having in mind, it would be better to contact me to
        clarify for yourself - I would always appreciate some kind of contact,
        and my email is provided in the Contact Information section
