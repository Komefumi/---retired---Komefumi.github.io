      <p>
        Mainly, what I&apos;m working towards at present is becoming a full
        fledged developer and graphics designer. This would mean I would be able
        to create entire web-based (and other platform based) projects, from end
        to end, including taking care of all the designing, planning, testing,
        and any other aspects by myself, in a reasonably short period of time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another way to say it would be that I&apos;m working towards becoming a
        product builder. Technology and design concerns primarily focused, at
        the moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, this isn&apos;t my ultimate goal, it is an important thing for me,
        but there are goals for me to accomplish through being able to build
        products.
      </p>
      <p>
        But this is what I&apos;m working on at the moment. I am studying some
        science and accounting now and then, and working on self improvement and
        on genuinely growing as a person.
      </p>
      <p>
        Still, there are more immediate large goals, and what I&apos;ve
        mentioned here is what I identify and move towards as my present one
